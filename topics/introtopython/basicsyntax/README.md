# Python basic syntax

Python is a very odd language when it comes to the syntax, as it is very simple and has no braces. An example of all of the basic python syntax rules is found in the file named naming_convention.py

### Overall syntax

The overall syntax of python is defined by one thing, white space. You'll see later that it is very important that everything is space correctly or else the program will not work.

### Naming

The first thing we need to learn is how to properly name things in python. Python uses every way of naming depending on what is being named.

#### Directories (Folder)

Directories are all lowercase, with no spaces, and are meant to be short.

#### File names

Files are meant to be all lowercase with underscores places between words.

#### Class names

Class names are meant to be CapsWord, the first letter of each word is meant to be capitalized, no spaces.

#### Variable names

This naming is the same as file names, lowercase with underscores instead of spaces.
